## Deploy

Use clasp (`clasp push` from project root). Filenames in Apps Script preserve
their `src/...` prefix; `HtmlService.createTemplateFromFile("src/pages/index")`
resolves correctly.

Run `setupConfigSheet` once after the first deploy to seed the CONFIG sheet
(idempotent — preserves existing edits).

## Apps Script setup runbook

All functions below live in `src/Config.gs` (or are referenced from it) and
are runnable from the Apps Script editor: pick the function name in the
**function dropdown** (top toolbar) → **Run**. Authorize the requested
scopes the first time each one runs. All functions are **idempotent** — re-
running is always safe.

| # | When to run | Function | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | First deploy, or after pulling new `DEFAULT_FEATURES` / `DEFAULT_TUNABLES` keys | `setupConfigSheet` | Creates / repopulates the `CONFIG` tab. Preserves existing operator-edited values; only missing keys are appended with defaults. |
| — | _Optional_ — pre-seed the attachment folder ID so the first upload doesn't have to walk Drive | `setupAttachmentFolder` | Walks `My Drive / TA_HANDOVER / ISSUE_UPLOADS / TA Issue Reporting Portal / Upload Photos/Video` (tolerating the ` (File responses)` suffix), writes the ID into `ATTACHMENT_FOLDER_ID`, and forces public-view on the folder. **Not required** — `uploadSubmissionPhotos_` calls the same resolver lazily on first upload and persists the result. |
| — | _Optional_ — bulk-publish legacy / Form-uploaded files already inside the folder | `makeAttachmentFolderPublic` | Sets the folder **and every file currently inside it** to "Anyone with the link – Viewer". New uploads are made public automatically by `trySharePublic_`; this only matters for files Google Forms / Drive added before public-view was wired in. Falls back to `ANYONE` if the strict variant is blocked, and logs a clear warning if both are blocked by a Workspace policy. |
| — | Anytime, to confirm where uploads will land | `whereDoUploadsGo` | Read-only. Prints the configured attachment folder's full path + URL. Does **not** change anything. |
| — | After editing a CONFIG row by hand | `clearConfigCache` | Forces the next API call to re-read the `CONFIG` sheet (otherwise the cached values stay for up to 5 minutes). |
| — | **Recovery** — when ticket ids have drifted, duplicated, or the counter is desynced | `renumberAllTicketIds` (`src/Recovery.gs`) | Takes a full XLSX backup to GitHub, then rewrites `TICKET_ID` across `PENDING_REVIEW` + `LIVE_ISSUES` + `CLOSED_ISSUES` + `ARCHIVES_ISSUES` as a single monotonic `TKT-NNNNN` series sorted by `DATE_REPORTED`. Resets the `TICKET_COUNTER` ScriptProperty to the new max. Drive folder names are not renamed (existing photos still resolve by id). |
| — | **Recovery** — when `PENDING_REVIEW` is corrupted / missing rows but `Form Responses 1` is intact | `recoverPendingFromForm` (`src/Recovery.gs`) | Takes a backup, wipes `PENDING_REVIEW` data rows, then re-imports every form row whose `{timestamp,resident,flat}` signature is **not** already in `LIVE_ISSUES` / `CLOSED_ISSUES`. Drops the cached `TICKET_COUNTER` so new pending ids are minted from the surviving live/closed max. |

### One-time bootstrap order (fresh deployment)

```
clasp push
  → in the Apps Script editor:
      1. setupConfigSheet           (seed CONFIG sheet — required)
  → photo uploads work immediately. On the first upload the script
    auto-resolves the canonical Drive path, persists the folder ID into
    CONFIG, and forces public-view on the folder.
  → optional follow-ups:
      • setupAttachmentFolder       (pre-seed the ID without an upload)
      • makeAttachmentFolderPublic  (retro-publish files added before this build)
      • whereDoUploadsGo            (verify path + URL in the log)
```

Every photo — old Form-uploaded ones, prior in-portal submissions, and
committee-side uploads added later — renders publicly in the web app's
`<img>` tags. The URLs stored in the sheet are normalized to the Drive
thumbnail endpoint (`https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=...&sz=w2000`)
by `splitPhotoLinks_` / `driveImageUrl_` in `src/Main.gs`, so no front-end
change is needed when adding new readers.

## Configuration

Every developer- / manager-tunable input lives in the **CONFIG** sheet:
identity (emails), assets (folder/logo), feature flags, numeric tunables.
See `src/Config.gs` (`DEFAULT_FEATURES`, `DEFAULT_TUNABLES`) for the full list.
Feature flags hide UI but leave internal helpers callable for dependent
modules.

## Specification

The single source of truth for behavior is [`requirement.md`](./requirement.md).
**Keep it updated whenever a feature, role capability, API action, sheet
column, or config key changes.** See [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](./.github/copilot-instructions.md)
for the agent rule that enforces this.
